Hi! 
I am a 25 year old data analyst located in Atlanta, GA. I love music & concerts, data, computers, & learning new skills and hobbies! Right now I'm studying blacksmithing and building out a forge in my backyard (which I'm sure I'll make a post about one day) <i class="fa-regular fa-face-smile"></i> <i class="fa-solid fa-hammer"></i>.

Feel free to contact me via email or reach out on LinkedIn.
